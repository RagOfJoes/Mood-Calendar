<p>This web application is my first real attempt at creating a full stack web application. Which essentially just means that a lot of sleepless nights researching and head scratching occured. This being my first full stack web application also meant that a lot of lessons were learned along with some new found technologies(for me atleast). Below will list some of the main obstacles that I faced whilst creating this web application.</p>

## Obstacle One
<p>Upon researching the many different methodologies one can utilize for user authentication I came across these things called <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction/" target="_blank"><b>JSON Web Tokens(JWTs)</b></a> which are a type of token format that have been, atleast as far as I'm aware, recently used as a form of authentication. One of the main things that really attracted me towards JWTs were the fact that they were able to carry information that were digitally signed with a public/private key pair. JWTs are also meant to be stateless meaning that the token itself contains all the information needed for a server to verify a user. This meant that once a user has signed up and has been verified the server can then serve up a token and then store it inside the client with which the web app can constantly use as a form of verification, much like a drivers license, to allow the user into protected routes without ever having the need to sign in ever again. At the time I thought that with JWTs a login page will be unnecessary because once a token has been created and has been stored inside the client the user will have no need to ever log in. However, upon further researching I found that tokens were encoded by Base64 which essentially meant that anyone and I mean anyone can decode a token and figure out its payload contents. This discovery proved to be formidable as I essentially had to </p>
